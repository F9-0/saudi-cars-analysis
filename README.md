An in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the used car market in Saudi Arabia. This project cleans, analyzes, and visualizes a dataset of used car listings to uncover key trends and insights.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of a used car dataset from Saudi Arabia. By cleaning the raw data and applying various data analysis techniques, this project aims to answer key questions about the market, such as:
- Which car brands and models are the most prevalent?
- What are the main price trends and distributions?
- How do factors like age, city, and transmission type affect a vehicle's value?

This notebook serves as a complete, end-to-end example of an EDA project, from data loading and cleaning to visualization and conclusion.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles non-numeric values (e.g., 'Negotiable') in the price column and ensures data types are correct for analysis.
- **Brand Analysis:** Identifies the top 10 most listed car brands in the market.
- **Price Analysis:** Visualizes the distribution of car prices and the strong correlation between a car's age and its average price.
- **Geographic Insights:** Compares average car prices across the top 10 cities with the most listings.
- **Feature Exploration:** Includes analysis of other features like transmission type distribution.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for the analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and processing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating high-quality, insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** As the interactive environment for conducting and presenting the analysis.
